                                hey, i'm arbaz ahmad. i love coding, thrives on technical stuff, and sometimes writing
                                writing.
                                there's something about breaking down complex problems and building things from scratch
                                that keeps me going.
                                whether it's writing a piece of code, analyzing a chess position, or sharing my thoughts
                                on life,
                                i love putting ideas into action.<span class="dots">..</span>

                                    Islam changed my life in ways i never expected. it gave me clarity, discipline, and
                                    a sense of purpose.
                                    in a world that constantly tries to pull you in a thousand directions, faith became
                                    my anchor.
                                    it taught me patience, resilience, and above all, gratitude. no matter what happens,
                                    islam always reminds
                                    me to stay grounded and keep pushing forward.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    academically, i've spent 16 years in education, with 4 of those years dedicated to
                                    earning my b.tech in computer science & engineering.
                                    it's been a journey filled with algorithms, data structures, debugging nightmares,
                                    and countless cups of chai.
                                    coding isn't just a skill; it's an art of solving problems and making life
                                    easier—one line at a time.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    when i'm not coding or writing, you'll probably find me deep in a game of chess.
                                    strategy, patience, and the thrill of a good attack—chess is an art i can never get
                                    enough of.
                                    if you ever want to play, add me on

                                    and let's see who really runs the board!

                                <p>
                                    But beyond chess and coding, I have another passion—sports. I’m a die-hard fan of
                                    <span class="tooltip">UFC
                                        <span class="tooltip-box">Ultimate Fighting Championship</span>
                                    </span>, cricket, and football. There's something about the mindset of a fighter,
                                    the technical brilliance of a footballer, and the strategic plays in cricket
                                    that completely captivate me. I follow the UFC fights religiously, celebrate every
                                    cricket World Cup, and enjoy the thrill
                                    of football matches where anything can happen in the last minute.
                                </p>


                                <p>
                                    oh, and let’s not forget—i’m obsessed with the <span class="tooltip">UFC

                                    </span>.
                                    the adrenaline, the discipline, the absolute dominance inside the octagon—it’s a
                                    whole different world, and i love every bit of it.
                                    from khabib nurmagomedov’s legendary smesh style to the unpredictable knockouts, MMA
                                    is something i could talk about for hours.

                                    before GATE, i couldn't even sit for one hour straight during mock tests. but on
                                    exam day,
                                    i wrote for three hours straight without losing focus. i didn't even feel the time
                                    passing.
                                    that alone was a huge personal achievement for me.

                                <p>
                                    however, the exam centre environment was chaotic. two people near me were talking
                                    loudly, and for a moment,
                                    it didn't even feel like an exam hall. i was getting irritated, feeling like i
                                    should tell them to shut up.
                                    but somehow, i controlled myself and focused on what mattered. after the exam, i
                                    felt strangely relieved.
                                </p>

                                    many people found the GATE 2025 exam moderate or even tough, but honestly, i found
                                    it easier than expected.
                                    my friend, who consistently ranked under top 10 in GO Classes

                                    said the paper wasn’t extremely easy
                                    but definitely not difficult either. he compared it to

                                        <span class="tooltip-box">Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering</span>

                                    questions looked easy but were actually tricky.
                                    one thing i noticed was how some MSQs (multiple select questions) were actually
                                    single-correct types,
                                    which made them confusing. also, the aptitude section was tougher than expected,
                                    while technical
                                    questions were mostly standard.

                                    <p>
                                        for over a year, i dedicated myself to 7–8 subjects, putting in countless hours
                                        of
                                        preparation.
                                        but despite all that, i still made silly mistakes in areas where i usually
                                        perform
                                        well, like
                                        CPU scheduling and pipelining.
                                        i attempted only 28 questions in the first half of the exam and struggled with
                                        time
                                        management.
                                        that was frustrating. now, at 25 years old, i keep wondering, what's next? do i
                                        reattempt GATE or move on?
                                        these thoughts keep circling in my head.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        the second shift of the exam had a lot of questions from aptitude, compiler
                                        design
                                        (CD), and operating systems (OS).
                                        but somehow, most of the ones i attempted were from context-free grammar (CFG),
                                        regular expressions (RE),
                                        and waiting time calculations.
                                        the MSQs were moderate, and NAT (numerical answer type) questions were
                                        difficult.
                                        in total, i attempted 51 questions and left 14 unanswered because guessing was
                                        impossible.

                                        this was my first GATE attempt. i graduated in 2024, and i worked way too hard
                                        for
                                        this.
                                        took countless mock tests and usually scored decently, even if not exceptionally
                                        high.
                                        time was never an issue in mocks, so running out of time on exam day was the
                                        last
                                        thing i expected.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        on the day of the exam, i felt a little nervous about some subjects but
                                        confident
                                        overall.
                                        i started with aptitude, which was very easy, and i got almost all of them
                                        right.
                                        for a moment, i thought maybe i would outperform even my own expectations.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        then came the technical section. i solved the first 6–7 questions quickly,
                                        and getting them right made me overconfident.
                                        but then, i got stuck on one question.
                                        my original plan was to mark tough questions for review and return to them
                                        later.
                                        but because i had solved everything so easily at the start,
                                        i refused to accept getting stuck—and that cost me dearly.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        before i realized it, i had wasted 11 minutes on just one question.
                                        by the time i moved on, my rhythm was already broken.
                                        the frustration of not solving that one question was messing with my head.
                                        the guilt of breaking my strategy overwhelmed my focus.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        i had barely two minutes left for the last few questions.
                                        i had marked many for review—including formula-based and easy ones—but time ran
                                        out.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        looking back, i realize that no matter how much you prepare,
                                        the actual exam always feels different.
                                        it's not just about knowing the concepts,
                                        but also about handling pressure and unexpected situations in the moment.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        despite everything, i am proud of the effort i put in.
                                        preparing for GATE with sincerity has deepened my understanding of core subjects
                                        and strengthened my love for technical problem-solving.

                                    <p>
                                        i don't know what the future holds,
                                        but one thing is certain—
                                        i will keep working harder.
                                        i can't wait to bounce back and prove myself again.

                                it’s finally here. the last 24 hours before my gate exam. i should be feeling confident,
                                ready to face it after a year of preparation.
                                but honestly, my mind is a mess. anxiety is hitting me from all sides. i try to recall
                                what i studied, but everything feels blurry.
                                it’s like my brain is refusing to cooperate at the very moment i need it the most.<span

                                    i have been preparing for this exam since april 2024. last year, i couldn’t even
                                    complete the paper, and that failure stayed with me.
                                    it wasn’t easy to accept, but instead of giving up, i made a promise to myself—i
                                    would
                                    come back stronger.
                                    i took a gap year, dedicating everything to this one exam.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    but things didn’t go as planned. the internet became both a blessing and a curse.
                                    distractions, wasted hours, and months slipping away before i even realized it.
                                    there were days when i was completely focused, solving problems like a machine, and
                                    then
                                    there were days when i felt lost, unable to do even the simplest things.
                                    and now, with only a day left, all those lost moments are coming back to haunt me.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    i know i haven’t covered everything. my syllabus isn’t complete, and i don’t feel
                                    fully prepared.
                                    the fear of not doing well is real. but at the same time, i remind myself—i have put
                                    in the effort.
                                    maybe it’s not perfect, maybe it’s not enough for a top score, but i have done my
                                    best with what i had.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    i am not expecting anything crazy. a 40+ score is what i hope for, enough to into
                                    one of the older IITs.
                                    PSUs are out of my league, and i have made peace with that. right now, all i
                                    want is to walk into that exam hall, stay calm, and give it my best.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    no matter what happens tomorrow, i know one thing for sure—this journey has
                                    taught me
                                    more than just technical concepts. it has taught me patience, discipline,
                                    and most importantly, the value of time. because time, once lost, never comes
                                    back. and
                                    if there’s one thing i regret, it’s not guarding it better.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    for now, i just need to breathe, trust whatever i have learned, and face
                                    tomorrow with a
                                    clear mind. let’s do this.

                                i have been preparing for GATE 2025 since april 2024. last year, i couldn't complete the
                                exam, and that feeling of failure weighed heavy on me.
                                but instead of letting it break me, i told myself, "next year, i'll do better." with
                                that hope, i took a gap year—one whole year dedicated to nothing but GATE.

                                    but life, as always, had other plans. the internet became my biggest enemy.
                                    distractions, technical issues, and wasted days turned into weeks, then months.
                                    before i knew it, i had lost almost 3-4 crucial months. the regret of lost time
                                    gnawed
                                    at me, yet no matter how much i cursed the past, the clock never turned back.
                                </p>

                                now, here i am, with less than 60% of the syllabus covered. fear creeps in
                                sometimes,
                                whispering that i’m not ready. but amidst all that chaos, i remind myself—i’ve
                                worked
                                hard on what i could.
                                maybe it’s not perfect, maybe it’s not enough, but i’m not giving up. i’m going to
                                give
                                my best with what i have and hope to score around 40 marks.

                                <p>
                                    it's not just about numbers anymore. it's about proving to myself that even when
                                    life
                                    throws me off track, i can still stand up and fight.

                                    and damn the internet—stealing my time, my focus, my peace! if there's one thing
                                    i've
                                    learned, it's this: the world won’t wait for you to get back on track,
                                    so guard your time like your life depends on it. because it does.
