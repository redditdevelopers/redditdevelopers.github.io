                                hey, i'm arbaz ahmad—a guy who breathes code, thrives on technical stuff, and finds peace in writing.
                                there's something about breaking down complex problems and building things from scratch that keeps me going.
                                whether it's writing a piece of code or a piece of my mind, i love putting thoughts into creation

                                    islam changed my life in ways i never expected. it gave me clarity, discipline, and
                                    a sense of purpose. in a world that constantly tries to pull you in a thousand directions, 
                                    faith became my anchor. it taught me patience, resilience, and above all, gratitude.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    academically, i've spent 16 years in education, with 4 of those years dedicated to
                                    earning my b.tech in computer science & engineering. it's been a journey of algorithms, debugging nightmares, 
                                    and countless cups of chai.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    when i'm not coding or writing, you'll probably find me deep in a game of chess.
                                    strategy, patience, and the thrill of a good attack—chess is an art i can never get
                                    enough of. if you ever want to play, add me on (<a href="https://www.chess.com/jusbatman" target="_blank">chess.com</a>),
                                    and let's see who really runs the board!

                                    oh, and let’s not forget—i’m a huge-ass fan of the UFC.
                                    the adrenaline, the mindset, the absolute dominance inside the octagon—it’s a whole
                                    different world, and i love every bit of it.

                                it’s finally here. the last 24 hours before my gate exam. i should be feeling confident, ready to face it after a year of preparation. 
                                but honestly, my mind is a mess. anxiety is hitting me from all sides. i try to recall what i studied, but everything feels blurry. 
                                it’s like my brain is refusing to cooperate at the very moment i need it the most.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                i have been preparing for this exam since april 2024. last year, i couldn’t even complete the paper, and that failure stayed with me. 
                                it wasn’t easy to accept, but instead of giving up, i made a promise to myself—i would come back stronger. 
                                i took a gap year, dedicating everything to this one exam.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                but things didn’t go as planned. the internet became both a blessing and a curse. distractions, wasted hours, and months slipping away before i even realized it. 
                                there were days when i was completely focused, solving problems like a machine, and then there were days when i felt lost, unable to do even the simplest things. 
                                and now, with only a day left, all those lost moments are coming back to haunt me.
                            <p>
                                i know i haven’t covered everything. my syllabus isn’t complete, and i don’t feel fully prepared. 
                                the fear of not doing well is real. but at the same time, i remind myself—i have put in the effort. 
                                maybe it’s not perfect, maybe it’s not enough for a top score, but i have done my best with what i had.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                i am not expecting anything crazy. a 40+ score is what i hope for, enough to get into one of the older IITs. 
                                PSUs are out of my league, and i have made peace with that. right now, all i want is to walk into that exam hall, stay calm, and give it my best.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                no matter what happens tomorrow, i know one thing for sure—this journey has taught me more than just technical concepts. it has taught me patience, discipline, 
                                and most importantly, the value of time. because time, once lost, never comes back. and if there’s one thing i regret, it’s not guarding it better.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                for now, i just need to breathe, trust whatever i have learned, and face tomorrow with a clear mind. let’s do this.
                            </p>

                                i have been preparing for GATE 2025 since april 2024. last year, i couldn't complete the
                                exam, and that feeling of failure weighed heavy on me.
                                but instead of letting it break me, i told myself, "next year, i'll do better." with
                                that hope, i took a gap year—one whole year dedicated to nothing but GATE.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                but life, as always, had other plans. the internet became my biggest enemy.
                                distractions, technical issues, and wasted days turned into weeks, then months.
                                before i knew it, i had lost almost 3-4 crucial months. the regret of lost time gnawed
                                at me, yet no matter how much i cursed the past, the clock never turned back.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                now, here i am, with less than 60% of the syllabus covered. fear creeps in sometimes,
                                whispering that i’m not ready. but amidst all that chaos, i remind myself—i’ve worked
                                hard on what i could.
                                maybe it’s not perfect, maybe it’s not enough, but i’m not giving up. i’m going to give
                                my best with what i have and hope to score around 40 marks.

                            <p>
                                it's not just about numbers anymore. it's about proving to myself that even when life
                                throws me off track, i can still stand up and fight.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                and damn the internet—stealing my time, my focus, my peace! if there's one thing i've
                                learned, it's this: the world won’t wait for you to get back on track,
                                so guard your time like your life depends on it. because it does.
                            </p>
