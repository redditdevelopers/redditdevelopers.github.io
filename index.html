                                hey, i'm arbaz ahmad—a guy who loves coding (i think), thrives on technical stuff, and
                                finds
                                peace in writing.
                                there's something about breaking down complex problems and building things from scratch
                                that keeps me going.
                                whether it's writing a piece of code or a piece of my mind, i love putting thoughts into
                                creation.<span class="dots">..</span>

                                    islam changed my life in ways i never expected. it gave me clarity, discipline, and
                                    a sense of purpose. in a world that constantly tries to pull you in a thousand
                                    directions,
                                    faith became my anchor. it taught me patience, resilience, and above all, gratitude.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    academically, i've spent 16 years in education, with 4 of those years dedicated to
                                    earning my b.tech in computer science & engineering. it's been a journey of
                                    algorithms, debugging nightmares, and countless cups of chai.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    when i'm not coding or writing, you'll probably find me deep in a game of chess.
                                    strategy, patience, and the thrill of a good attack—chess is an art i can never get
                                    enough of. if you ever want to play, add me on (<a

                                    and let's see who really runs the board!

                                    oh, and let’s not forget—i’m a huge-ass fan of the UFC.
                                    the adrenaline, the mindset, the absolute dominance inside the octagon—it’s a whole
                                    different world, and i love every bit of it.

                                reached the centre 1 hour and 30 minutes before the reporting time. had some doubts in
                                my mind
                                but reminded myself that i had prepared well for this moment. as soon as i got the
                                scribble pad,
                                i wrote 70+ for myself, believing i could achieve those marks.<span

                                    before gate, i couldn't even sit for one hour straight in mock tests. but on exam
                                    day,
                                    i wrote for three hours without breaking my concentration. i didn't even feel the
                                    time passing. that was
                                    a huge improvement for me. before the exam, two people near me were talking loudly.
                                    the exam centre did
                                    not even feel like an exam centre at that moment. i was feeling like i should beat
                                    them. but somehow i controlled myself. after the exam, i felt really good.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    many people said the exam was moderate or even tough, but honestly, i found it easy.
                                    my friend,
                                    who consistently ranked under 10 in go classes AIMT, said the paper was not
                                    extremely easy but definitely not difficult either.
                                    according to him, it was at the 2023 level, slightly easier than 2024. some
                                    questions seemed easy but were actually trick questions.
                                    some msqs were actually single-correct types, and the aptitude section was tougher
                                    than in 2024.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    for over a year, i prepared with 7–8 subjects, putting in so much effort. but
                                    despite all that,
                                    i made silly mistakes on topics i usually never mess up, like cpu scheduling and
                                    pipelining.
                                    i attempted only 28 questions in the beginning and couldn't complete all of them due
                                    to a lack of time.
                                    it felt frustrating. i am already 25 this year, and now i keep wondering what i
                                    should do next.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    the second shift paper had so many questions from APTI, CD, and OS. whatever i chose
                                    to attempt,
                                    i only got context-free grammar, regular expressions, and similar topics. there were
                                    also plenty of questions on roundabout time and waiting time.
                                    aptitude was very easy, but these CFG and RE questions really got me. MSQs were
                                    moderate, while NAT questions were difficult.
                                    i only attempted 51 questions and left 14 unanswered because they were impossible to
                                    guess.

                                    this was my first attempt. 2024 graduate. i worked way too hard for this. took
                                    countless mock tests and usually scored decently in them,
                                    even if not exceptionally well. time was never an issue in mocks, so running out of
                                    time in the actual exam was the last thing i had expected.
                                    on exam day, i was a little nervous about some subjects but felt confident overall.
                                    i started with aptitude, which was very easy.
                                    got almost all of them right. for a moment, i thought maybe i would end up
                                    performing even better than expected.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    then came the technical section. i solved the first 6–7 questions quickly, and
                                    getting them right made me overconfident.
                                    but then, i got stuck on one question. my plan was to mark difficult questions for
                                    review and come back to them later,
                                    but because i had solved everything so easily up to that point, i couldn't accept
                                    being stuck. before i realized it,
                                    i had wasted 11 minutes on just one question.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    i moved on, but the disappointment of not solving that question messed with my head.
                                    the guilt of breaking my strategy overwhelmed my focus.
                                    i got stuck on more questions, and by the time i managed to recover, i had barely
                                    two minutes left for the last two questions.
                                    i had marked so many questions for review, including formula-based and easy ones,
                                    but i had no time left to go back to them.

                                    looking back, i realize no matter how much you prepare, the actual exam feels
                                    different.
                                    it's not just about knowing how to solve problems but also about handling unexpected
                                    situations in the moment.
                                    despite everything, i am proud of the effort i put in. preparing for gate with
                                    sincerity has strengthened my
                                    understanding of core concepts and deepened my admiration for technical subjects.

                                    i don't know what the future holds, but one thing is certain – i will keep working
                                    harder.
                                    i can't wait to bounce back and prove myself again.

                                it’s finally here. the last 24 hours before my gate exam. i should be feeling confident,
                                ready to face it after a year of preparation.
                                but honestly, my mind is a mess. anxiety is hitting me from all sides. i try to recall
                                what i studied, but everything feels blurry.
                                it’s like my brain is refusing to cooperate at the very moment i need it the most.<span

                                <p>
                                    i have been preparing for this exam since april 2024. last year, i couldn’t even
                                    complete the paper, and that failure stayed with me.
                                    it wasn’t easy to accept, but instead of giving up, i made a promise to myself—i
                                    would
                                    come back stronger.
                                    i took a gap year, dedicating everything to this one exam.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    but things didn’t go as planned. the internet became both a blessing and a curse.
                                    distractions, wasted hours, and months slipping away before i even realized it.
                                    there were days when i was completely focused, solving problems like a machine, and
                                    then
                                    there were days when i felt lost, unable to do even the simplest things.
                                    and now, with only a day left, all those lost moments are coming back to haunt me.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    i know i haven’t covered everything. my syllabus isn’t complete, and i don’t feel
                                    fully prepared.
                                    the fear of not doing well is real. but at the same time, i remind myself—i have put
                                    in the effort.
                                    maybe it’s not perfect, maybe it’s not enough for a top score, but i have done my
                                    best with what i had.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    i am not expecting anything crazy. a 40+ score is what i hope for, enough to into
                                    one of the older IITs.
                                    PSUs are out of my league, and i have made peace with that. right now, all i
                                    want is to walk into that exam hall, stay calm, and give it my best.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    no matter what happens tomorrow, i know one thing for sure—this journey has
                                    taught me
                                    more than just technical concepts. it has taught me patience, discipline,
                                    and most importantly, the value of time. because time, once lost, never comes
                                    back. and
                                    if there’s one thing i regret, it’s not guarding it better.

                                <p>
                                    for now, i just need to breathe, trust whatever i have learned, and face
                                    tomorrow with a
                                    clear mind. let’s do this.

                                i have been preparing for GATE 2025 since april 2024. last year, i couldn't complete the
                                exam, and that feeling of failure weighed heavy on me.
                                but instead of letting it break me, i told myself, "next year, i'll do better." with
                                that hope, i took a gap year—one whole year dedicated to nothing but GATE.

                                    but life, as always, had other plans. the internet became my biggest enemy.
                                    distractions, technical issues, and wasted days turned into weeks, then months.
                                    before i knew it, i had lost almost 3-4 crucial months. the regret of lost time
                                    gnawed
                                    at me, yet no matter how much i cursed the past, the clock never turned back.
                                </p>

                                now, here i am, with less than 60% of the syllabus covered. fear creeps in
                                sometimes,
                                whispering that i’m not ready. but amidst all that chaos, i remind myself—i’ve
                                worked
                                hard on what i could.
                                maybe it’s not perfect, maybe it’s not enough, but i’m not giving up. i’m going to
                                give
                                my best with what i have and hope to score around 40 marks.

                                <p>
                                    it's not just about numbers anymore. it's about proving to myself that even when
                                    life
                                    throws me off track, i can still stand up and fight.
